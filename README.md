# LastFM-NowPlaying
A Python Script that pull's a user's current song from LastFM then writes it to a text file for use with an external program.

# Motivation
Now Playing for livestreaming has always been limited. Either, your platform wasn't supported or it didn't offer easy switching between platforms (i.e. switching between Spotify and Youtube). On top of that, if you're not on Windows, your options for tools are even more limited. Instead of writing in support for each different platform, I created a script that supports only one, LastFM. LastFM is a popular musical profile site which can get what music you're listening to from a majority of music platforms out today. With it a user can use any musical platform of their choice and display their music information on their livestream.

### Usage
./LastFM-NowPlaying.py

Input your LastFM username. Then let it run.

songs will automatically write to currentSong.txt which you can link in OBS or your prefered streaming software.

To close, type in "exit" then press Enter.
